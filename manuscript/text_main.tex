Pathogen genome sequences are a unique source to trace routes of infection and reveal how transmission dynamics change over time. We successfully sequenced 11,357 SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Switzerland throughout 2020, representing 80\% of Swiss genomes available from this time. Here we use a representative sequence subset of all these Swiss sequences to  (i) identify putatively independent introductions into Switzerland and (ii) quantify within-Switzerland transmission dynamics from these introductions. 

We confirm that in Spring 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was introduced many times prior to border closures but that most introductions were quickly driven to extinction during the spring lockdown. Introductions peaked before European incidence, indicating border closures did reduce imports. In Summer 2020, introductions rose again as borders re-opened. 
% The number of confirmed cases went up x-fold within two months while the reproductive number for the outbreaks in Switzerland was likely no more than 1, meaning introductions were driving the increase. [would that make sense? see also my comments at very top].  
With less stringent  public health measures compared to the Spring, many of these introductions persisted into the Fall, when Switzerland experienced a large surge in cases.   

Finally, we estimate that in Summer 2020, the transmission rate in newly introduced outbreaks  was initially higher, then slowed down \summermaxdampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\ - \summermindampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\% after the first analyzed genome sample was taken. 
% This slowdown is in addition to possible slowdowns due to superspreading seeding an introduced transmission chain. 
A plausible  explaination of this summertime ``slowdown'' dynamic is a successful test-trace-isolate implementation which roughly halved the numbers of transmissions once an introduction was identified in summer but showed no effect in fall.

% In summary, Spring 2020 border closures caused introductions into Switzerland to peak before European incidence.
% % [Summary on an effect of border closures [TRUE? see my comment]?]  In summary, introductions were driving the increase in cases in summer 2020. 
% Once an introduction occurred, we see that stringency of local general measures is associated with the longevity of transmission chains. For specific measures we suggest that  test-trace-isolate  was able to half transmission rates in summer once an outbreak was identified. 
Our analysis based on genomic sequencing data helps understand the importance of international travel, general NPIs and specific test-trace-isolate efforts towards a national epidemic, an increasingly relevant topic as global vaccination campaigns continue at an uneven pace and new variants of concern spread internationally.

\section{Introduction}

% Claim importance
A crucial task in public health is to evaluate measures aimed at slowing SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Such measures aim to prevent new introductions into a region or contain ongoing transmission chains, for example with quarantine for travellers or social distancing. So far, mathematical models have helped estimate effects from broad measures like travel bans and lockdowns. These methods use data on case or death counts and travel volumes, e.g. \cite{Flaxman2020, Tian2020}. However, these data are not informative at the scale of individual introductions or transmission chains because there is no information to link related cases.

Detailed contact tracing data could help link cases to reconstruct introductions and transmission chains. However, these data are difficult to collect and not widely available. Instead, pathogen genome sequences can be used to link cases \cite{Kraemer}. Many RNA viruses accumulate mutations on the same time-scale as host-to-host transmission. For example a typical SARS-CoV-2 strain will accumulate $\sim$2 mutations per month along its $\sim$30,000 nucleotide-long genome \cite{Nextstrainteam}. These mutations allow us to construct a viral phylogeny (a ``family tree'' of viruses) that approximates the underlying host-to-host transmission tree. 

SARS-CoV-2 genomes were collected at an unprecedented scale in 2020 \cite{Alm2020} and they have been used extensively to characterize transmission dynamics. Two broad categories of methods are commonly used: phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods. Phylogenetic studies reconstruct a ``best-guess'' phylogeny and calculate statistics directly from this phylogeny without further explicit models. For example, \cite{Mallon2020, DuPlessis2021} showed that national lock-downs during the early Irish and English epidemics reduced lineage sizes and diversity according to reconstructed phylogenies. Phylodynamic studies assume the phylogeny must arise from some underlying model of transmission between hosts (and possibly migration of hosts between regions). This approach enables estimation of population-level transmission dynamics. For example, \cite{Miller2020, Geoghegan2020a, Muller2020a} showed that public health measures reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates in Israel, New Zealand, and Washington State, USA. 

% Indicate a gap
It is rather difficult to quantify effects of public health measures using genomic data. Firstly, sequencing efforts vary by region and through time. Often, available samples are unrepresentative of the whole population \cite{Villabona-Arenas2020, DeMaio2015}. Secondly, SARS-CoV-2 sequencing was high compared to viral diversity, in particular during the early epidemic in Spring 2020. If many sequences are similar or identical the phylogeny will contain polytomies. This means the phylogeny is only a coarse approximation of the  host-to-host transmission tree \cite{Villabona-Arenas2020}. Even worse, arbitrarily resolving polytomies may give misleading or overly confident estimates \cite{Morel2021}. Finally, real-world transmission dynamics are governed by complex population structure that is difficult to model. Highly parameterized phylodynamic models can help, as in \cite{Miller2020, Geoghegan2020a, Muller2020a}. Models with multiple compartments account for sampling biases and population structure and the phylogeny can be integrated out as a nuisance parameter. Recent developments are speeding these methods up \cite{Lemey2021}, but they are generally too computationally complex to fit to thousands of genomes.

% State that our paper fills the gap 
Here we present a two-step analysis framework carefully combining phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods to address these challenges and quantify transmission dynamics over a longer time-frame in Switzerland. In each step, we condition on clusters in the sample set, an approach inspired by  \cite{Muller2020} and \cite{DuPlessis}. This ensures computational feasibility. To limit sampling biases, we down-sample sequences to be more spatio-temporally representative of the Swiss epidemic. Finally, we account for phylogenetic uncertainty from high sampling and comparatively low viral diversity by conservatively reporting estimates across a range of plausible polytomy resolutions.

% Emphasize our main results 
We use our framework to quantify transmission dynamics in Switzerland, with a particular focus on the effects of public health measures on the Swiss epidemic. First, we asked when introductions occurred and how long they persisted in Switzerland. We show that SARS-CoV-2 introductions were high prior to Spring 2020 border closures and increased again after these measures were relaxed in Summer 2020. Unlike in Spring, when new introductions were quickly driven to extinction during lockdown, these summertime introductions persisted over long periods and into Fall 2020. We then asked how well introductions were controlled once they were identified by public health authorities. We reasoned that test-trace-isolate measures can only be enforced once authorities know about a case. Therefore, if successful, we expect test-trace-isolate efforts to slow transmission after the first case in a transmission chain is identified. In Summer 2020 we estimate that transmission slowed \summermaxdampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\ - \summermindampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\% after collection of the first analyzed genome sequence. While we hypothesize this slowdown is due to test-trace-isolate measures, we also discuss other possible explanations. Although we focus on epidemiological insights from the Swiss epidemic, our framework can be applied to any regional SARS-CoV-2 epidemic with data available on GISAID \cite{GISAID}. We perform a small comparison using New Zealand data to illustrate this. 

\section{Results}
We analyzed \nfocalsamples\ SARS-CoV-2 genomes collected in Switzerland, representing the Swiss epidemic from the first detected case on 25. Feb. through \maxdate. These data are a sub-sample of all available Swiss genomes aimed to be more spatio-temporally representative of the Swiss epidemic compared to all available genomes while maintaining a large sample size (Figure  \ref{fig:downsampling_representativeness}). We limited the sampling period to avoid transmission rate variation due to more transmissible variants of concern, such as alpha, which arose in late 2020.

\subsection{Introductions, then persistence drive the 2020 Swiss epidemic}

First, we identified independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Switzerland using genome data and estimated their persistence. To do this, we first divided Swiss SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences into different Pango lineages (Table S3) and constructed an approximate maximum-likelihood phylogeny for each lineage of Swiss and genetically similar foreign sequences. Next, we identified independently introduced singleton sequences or clusters of Swiss sequences from these lineage phylogenies as described in the Methods. Importantly, we identified two different sets of introductions resulting from two extreme resolutions of polytomies. This allows us to report estimates across the range of strictly bifurcating phylogenies consistent with the genome data. We refer to these different sets of plausible introductions as ``few'' or ``many'' introductions.

We estimate the analyzed sequences came from between \nchainsmin\ (few) and \nchainsmax\ (many) independent introductions into Switzerland. These introductions are roughly power law-distributed in size, with the 10 largest introductions accounting for \maxlargestchainsper\ to \minlargestchainsper \% of genome samples (Figure \ref{fig:chain_size_dist}). From a down-sampling analysis, we see that we do not reach saturation - if we were to include more sequences, we would identify more introductions (Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_figs}a). 

% For comparison: UK transmission lineages have power-law decay w/ alpha = 0.79 for chains 2 <= x <= 50, 1.26 for chains > 50. 
% Similar to Louis, I see chain sizes as power-law distributed, with a change in scale factor at ~ chain size 50. 
% The scaling factors I estimate are higher than his though (~1.2 for <= 50 and ~1.4 for >50). So, our Swiss chain sizes decay more sharply (fewer larger chains) than his UK transmission lineages.

Therefore, the true number of introductions into Switzerland is difficult to estimate using our phylogenetic approach. However, since we sampled genome sequences proportional to the number of confirmed cases through time, we expect that trends through time in the number and persistence of introductions are representative of the underlying dynamics. Figure \ref{fig:chain-longevity} shows that the number of new introductions each month rose sharply from Feb. to Mar. 2020, we estimate by a factor of 63.5 to 173. This coincides with global SARS-CoV-2 infections rising in Feb. and Mar. 2020. Switzerland closed its borders from 13. Mar. until 15. Jun. 2020. New introductions dropped month-to-month during this time, from the high in Mar. until a low in May. or Jun. 2020, depending on the polytomy assumption we make. All in all, this represents a decrease by a factor of 0.03 to 0.09. Finally, new introductions rose more-or-less steadily from Jun. until Nov. 2020, coinciding with borders reopening across Europe and globally. 

Of course, new introductions cannot sustain a local epidemic unless they persist in the local population. Our analysis suggests several introductions were quite persistent in Switzerland, including \nspanningchainsfebnovmin\ that may have persisted from the start of the Swiss epidemic in Feb. 2020 until Nov. 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:chain-longevity-matrix}). On average, introductions persisted in Switzerland \meantimetolastsamplemax\ - \meantimetolastsamplemin\ days from first to last sampling. However, introductions in early 2020 were less persistent than later introductions. Figure \ref{fig:chain-longevity} shows that $<$ 17\% of new introductions in Mar. and Apr. persisted more than 60 days while  9\% to 54\% of new introductions each month between Jul. and Sep. 2020 persisted this long.

\subsection{Genome data capture Summer 2020 ``slowdown'' transmission dynamics}

Next, we used the identified introductions to quantify time-varying transmission dynamics in Switzerland in a Bayesian phylodynamic framework. To do this, we used a birth-death model with serial sampling, as originally described by \cite{stadler_2010_bds}. In a nutshell, our model assumes introductions occur at some constant rate into Switzerland and once introduced, all lineages are transmitted between hosts according to a time-varying transmission rate, die out upon recovery/death of the host according to a constant becoming-uninfectious rate, and yield genome samples with a time-varying sampling probability. We assume individuals who test positive adhere to the self-isolation regulations, so lineages die out when they are sampled. Under this parameterization, the effective reproductive number in Switzerland is a function of the transmission rate, becoming-uninfectious rate, and sampling probability.

On top of this model, we added a transmission rate ``damping'' factor as shown in Figure \ref{fig:phylo-methods}. This aims to test whether test-trace-isolate efforts in Switzerland slowed transmission once introductions were detected. We reasoned test-trace-isolate could slow transmission only shortly after the first case tests positive but not beforehand. We include this concept in our model by allowing the transmission rate to decrease by a multiplicative factor 2 days after each introduction is first sampled. The 2-day delay aims to account for the time between an individual giving a sample and contact tracers being notified. Finally, we allowed the damping factor to vary between Spring, Summer, and Fall in Switzerland - periods characterized by very different case loads and testing regimes (Figure \ref{fig:scale-factor}a). We used a spike-and-slab prior on this factor to include the possibility of no transmission slow-down. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.75\linewidth]{figures/phylodynamic_method_example.png}
\caption{Illustration of how transmission rate damping is modelled. (A) shows a background time-varying reproductive number Re before any damping. In each of the coloured areas (Green = Spring, orange = Summer, and purple = Fall), a different transmission rate dampening factor is assumed. The black boxes in (A) highlight the spread of two example introductions (B) and (C). The genome data sampled from these introductions are shown as red dots in (B) and (C). The appropriate damping factor on Re is applied to each introduction 2 days after the first genome sample (dashed line). More concretely, in each step of the MCMC (Markov chain Monte Carlo) analysis, the background Re (A), the three dampening factors, and the two phylogenies (B and C) are sampled. The likelihood of the sampled genome data is calculated given the ``applied'' effective reproductive number specific to each introduction (B \& C, bottom).}  
\label{fig:phylo-methods}
\end{figure}

Across several model configurations (see supplemental text) and our two polytomy assumptions, we estimate effective reproductive number values through time that roughly capture the same trends as estimates based on confirmed case counts (Figure \ref{fig:ReSampProbResults}). On the other hand, sampling probability estimates in Fall 2020 are strongly dependent on the prior (Figure \ref{fig:ReSampProbResults}), which we discuss more in the supplemental text.

Based on our main model configuration, we estimate a \summermaxdampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\ to \summermindampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\% slow-down in transmission after introductions are first sampled during Summer 2020. In comparison, we estimate no or very little slow-down in relation to first sampling during Fall 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:scale-factor}). These results are qualitatively robust to conditioning on few or many introductions and imposing a strong prior bound on the sampling proportion (Figure \ref{fig:DampingFactorResults}). In contrast, estimates in Spring 2020 are inconsistent. This could be because low genomic diversity in SARS-CoV-2 during this period causes high phylogenetic uncertainty. In summary, we report an evident ``slowdown'' dynamic in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland in Summer 2020 where transmission slows when the first genome sample analyzed is collected.

Thus, the difference between estimates in light and dark grey are due to phylogenetic uncertainty.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Comparison to the New Zealand epidemic}
While Switzerland is centrally located in Europe and well-connected to other countries, especially those in the (normally) barrier-free Schengen travel zone, New Zealand is a relatively isolated island nation. Additionally, New Zealand aimed to eradicate SARS-CoV-2 throughout 2020 using strong measures, such as keeping its borders closed, while Switzerland re-opened to Europe in early Summer 2020. We compared our estimates for the transmission slow-down factor between Switzerland in Spring, Summer, and Fall 2020 with New Zealand before and after an evident breakpoint in mid-May when local transmission was briefly eradicated \cite{Geoghegan2020}. Case numbers were subsequently held at lower levels through Dec. 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:DampingFactorResults}B). Estimated damping factors in New Zealand before and after 15. May were comparable or stronger than in Switzerland during Summer and Fall 2020 (Figure \ref{fig:scale-factor}).

\section{Discussion}
% Re-state the goal and the main results
We aimed to assess genomic evidence for the impact of major public health measures on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Switzerland. We estimate that after Swiss borders were partially closed on 13. Mar. 2020, the number of newly sampled lineages per month dropped by a factor of 0.03 to 0.09. These measures were mostly lifted again on 15. Jun 2020. Correspondingly, we estimate month-on-month increases in the number of new introductions throughout Summer 2020. Next, we estimate that introductions spreading during the Spring 2020 lockdown were driven to extinction relatively quickly compared to introductions in Summer 2020, 9-54\% of which persisted at least 60 days in Switzerland. Finally, we quantified a summertime ``slowdown'' dynamic in which introductions initially spread faster, then slowed between \summermaxdampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB\ and \summermindampingpercentmedianCHEnosampUB \%. Below, we outline why this dynamic might be due to successful test-trace-isolate measures.

% Contextualize the results: caveats
First, we will address the limitations of the phylogenetic and phylodynamic methods we used. Most obviously, estimates on the number, timing, and duration of introductions are very uncertain due to incomplete sampling and phylogenetic uncertainty. Others have struggled with the same challenge \cite{Morel2021} and we support their conclusion: one should consider estimates generated across a range of plausible phylogenies, as estimates based on any one phylogeny may be misleading. In our analysis, we present estimate ranges based on two extreme resolutions of polytomies. This is less computationally intensive, but more conservative, compared to generating a larger set of plausible phylogenies as in Bayesian analyses and as \cite{Morel2021} suggested for maximum-likelihood analyses.

Further, genomic data are observational data subject to potential sampling biases. Available sequences may not represent the overall infected population due to time-varying testing regimes, geographic or demographic sampling biases, and demographic skew in disease severity. In particular, we expect severe cases, contacts of positive cases, and populations with better access to testing/better sequencing coverage are sampled more. To avoid some of these biases, we used samples collected from across Switzerland and down-sampled the regions and time periods where sequences were over-represented compared to case numbers. Thus, we argue that our final data set is representative of trends in transmission dynamics through time. We caution against interpreting the absolute numbers of introductions identified and the persistence of any specific introduction. Finally, we expect changes through time to be primarily due to NPIs or seasonal effects because our sampling period is prior to the identification of more transmissible variants of concern and prior to vaccines being available. 
% So far, we have highlighted trends through time in introductions that coincide with the Spring border closure in Switzerland, and in persistence that coincide with the implementation and release of a Spring lockdown. However, since we don't consider population structure within Switzerland, it is possible some persistent introductions are not due to relaxed lockdown measures but rather due to transmission in sub-populations with more contacts, less access to testing, or other factors that make it difficult to contain the virus.

% Contextualize the results: interpretations
Despite these limitations, a major benefit of using genome data is that we can link related cases. This allows us to investigate transmission dynamics within introductions, namely whether there is evidence for a transmission slow-down once introductions were sampled. Without genome data to differentiate cases into independent introductions and chains of transmission, this would not be possible. This distinguishes our work from simulation studies aiming to quantify a theoretical effect of contact tracing. 

Here we discuss why the ``slowdown'' dynamic we quantified may be reflective of test-trace-isolate measures. First, we discuss a few alternate explanations. For one, returning travellers have been implicated in transmitting more than non-travellers \cite{Hodcroft2021}. Thus, a passive transmission slow-down might happen when the virus moves into the non-traveller population. However, we would expect travellers in Fall to have similar contact networks as those in Summer. Instead, transmission damping is only evident in Switzerland in Summer 2020 when case counts were low. This could be because manual contact tracing (as in Switzerland) likely functions better when overall case loads are low. A second alternate explanation for the slowdown dynamic might be that contacts of positive cases are tested more intensely. I.e. close contacts are encouraged to get tested, yielding an apparent ``burst'' of samples around the first detected case. If so, we can still interpret the slowdown dynamic as evidence that test-trace-isolate measures were working, but it is difficult to say precisely how much transmission actually slowed. Finally, we also compared our Swiss estimates to New Zealand, where we quantified a comparable or greater transmission damping upon sampling during two different periods in 2020. This is expected since New Zealand implemented very strong isolation measures for returning travellers.

% % Argue for utility
% Finally, we argue the two-step analysis framework we developed may be useful to others since it enables rapid analysis of national-size data sets. In particular, the phylogenetic analysis uses semi-public data from GISAID and requires limited computational resources. To reduce data set size and computation time, one can increase sub-sampling, reduce the time-frame of interest, or specify a subset of Pango lineages using a yaml-formatted configuration file. The implementation currently relies on an in-house database based on GISAID and other external data sources. Soon, we will adapt it to use a public API based on fully public data from GenBank hosted by Nextstrain (LAPIS). Users will set configurations via the single configuration file and then the analysis can be run via Docker or Singularity without further modification. The phylodynamic analysis setup is provided as XML files for BEAST2 in the project github repository.

% Argue for importance
Our findings are important because they highlight the effect of major public health measures on the Swiss epidemic. Our analysis suggests that strict public health measures like the partial border closure and lockdown in Spring 2020 helped prevent and contain new introductions. However, these measures are naturally unsustainable. We estimate that when case counts are maintained at a low level, as in Summer 2020 in Switzerland and in New Zealand, new introductions initially spread more quickly, but then slow down. Estimates from Fall 2020 in Switzerland show that no such slow-down occurred when case counts were high. We speculate this is due to test-trace-isolate resources being overwhelmed. In conclusion, our results argue for the benefits of test-trace-isolate efforts, thoughtful quarantine policies, and aiming to maintain case counts at a low level while vaccines are distributed and treatment options continue to improve.

\section{Methods}
\subsection*{Genome sequencing and quality filtering}
Most of the Swiss SARS-CoV-2 genomes analyzed until 31. Dec 2020 were generated by the Swiss SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing Consortium. Here, we briefly describe the swab-to-sequence process for these samples. RNA extracts from qPRC-positive patient naso- or oral-pharangeal swabs were provided by Viollier AG, a Swiss medical diagnostics company. RNA extraction was done with either the Abbott m2000sp or Seegene STARMag 96x4 Universal Cartridge RNA extraction kit. Extracts were then  transferred to the Genomics Facility Basel or the Functional Genomics Center Zurich for whole-genome sequencing. Both centers used the ARCTIC v3 primer scheme \cite{Quick2017, ARCTICNetwork} to generate tiled, approximately 400bp-long amplicons. Library preparation was done with the New England Biolabs (NEB) library preparation kit. Libraries were sequenced on Illumina MiSeq or NovaSeq machines, resulting in 2 x 251 base reads. Bioinformatics was done using V-pipe \cite{Posada-Cespedes2020}, including read trimming and filtering with PRINSEQ \cite{Schmieder2011}, alignment to GenBank accession MN908947 \cite{Wu2020} with bwa \cite{Li2009}, and consensus base calling. For consensus base calling, positions with $<$5x coverage are masked with ``N'', positions with $>$5\% and $>$2 reads supporting a minor base are called with IUPAC ambiguity codes, and positions with $>$50\% reads supporting a deletion are called with ``-''. We rejected samples with $<$20,000 non-N bases. The consensus sequences we generated have been made publicly available on both GISAID (submitting lab: Department of Biosystems Science and Engineering, ETH Zürich) and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (study: PRJEB38472).

We supplemented our Swiss data with other Swiss sequences and foreign sequences available via GISAID (accessed 31. May 2021). From the full set of sequences available on GISAID, we removed from consideration non-human samples, samples $<$ 27000 bases long, and samples flagged by the Nextclade tool \cite{Aksamentov} for one of the following reasons: suspiciously clustered SNPs (QC SNP clusters status metric not ``good''; $>=$ 6 mutations in 100 bases), too many private mutations (QC private mutations status metric not ``good''; $>=$ 10 mutations from the nearest tree node), or overall bad quality (Nextclade QC overall status ``bad''). We aligned the sequences to the reference genome MN908947.3 using MAFFT \cite{katoh_mafft:_2002}. Finally, we followed the Nextstrain pipeline's recommendation to mask the first 100 and last 50 sites of the alignment \cite{Nextstraina} since the start and end of SARS-CoV-2 sequences are prone to sequencing error \cite{DeMaio2020}.

\subsection*{Sampling procedure}

From the quality-filtered alignment of GISAID sequences, we selected a focal set of sequences from Switzerland and a context set of sequences from abroad.

For the focal sequences from Switzerland, we aimed to select a spatially and temporally representative sample. Therefore, we down-sampled available sequences to \fpeval{\maxsamplingpercent}\% of confirmed case counts in each Swiss Canton each week between \mindate\ and \maxdate. Where there were not enough sequences available from a Canton in a week, we took all available sequences. To reduce the size of the alignments for phylogenetic analysis, we divided the focal Swiss set into Pango lineages \cite{Rambaut}, similar to \cite{DuPlessis2021}. Lineages composed of $>$ 50\% Swiss sequences were aggregated into their parent lineage(s) until $<=$ 50\% were Swiss. This aims to ensure that each analyzed lineage originated outside of Switzerland.

% describe nextstrain priority protocol for sim dataset
For the context sequences from abroad, we aimed to select the most genetically similar sequences to focal Swiss sequences. This set should help distinguish between SARS-CoV-2 strains unique to Switzerland (likely within-Switzerland transmission) and strains also circulating abroad (possibly recent introductions). To select this set, we applied the Nextstrain priority script \cite{Nextstrain} to rank sequences from abroad by their genetic similarity to Swiss sequences in each lineage alignment. Then, we selected \similaritycontextscalefactor\ times as many  context sequences as focal Swiss sequences for each analyzed lineage. 

% summarize the sample set
In the supporting information, we show sensitivity analyses for these choices. We tested different numbers of focal Swiss sequences and different ratios of context to focal sequences, with the conclusion that the most variation is still due to how we define an introduction (see ``Identifying introductions'', below). The final dataset used for analysis includes \nfocalsamples\ focal sequences from Switzerland and \nsimcontext\ genetically similar context sequences from abroad.

\subsection*{Timetree generation}
We estimated the maximum likelihood phylogeny for each lineage alignment using IQ-TREE \cite{Nguyen2014} under an HKY substitution model \cite{Hasegawa1985} with empirical base frequencies and 4 gamma rate categories. We then rooted each phylogeny with \outgroupgisaidepiisls\ as an outgroup and estimated branch lengths in time units using least-squares dating (LSD) \cite{To2016} with a strict molecular clock and a minimum mutation rate of 8x10-4 substitutions per site per year. We additionally assumed the root date to be between 15. Nov. and 24. Dec. 2019 (roughly in line with estimates provided by Nextstrain \cite{Nextstrainteam}) and set the minimum branch length to zero. Sequences that violated the strict clock assumption (z-score threshold > 3) were removed and near-zero branches ($<$1.7x10-5 substitutions per site per year) were collapsed into polytomies, reflecting the fact that the sequence data is not sufficient to resolve the ordering of these transmission events. Given the root date constraints, the mutation rate conformed to the lower bound of 8x10-4 with extremely narrow confidence intervals. Confidence intervals for node dates were generated in LSD by re- sampling branch lengths 100 times under a lognormal relaxed clock model with standard deviation 0.4.

\subsection*{Identifying introductions}
We ``picked'' putative Swiss transmission chains (collections of two or more genome sequences resulting from within-Switzerland transmission) off of each Pango lineage tree according to the following criteria: at least 2 Swiss sequences are part of a clade in the tree and the subtree spanned by these Swiss sequences is monophyletic upon removing (a) up to 3 export events where (b) only one export event may occur along each internal branch. Exports are defined to be clades containing non-Swiss sequences. We chose a conservative value for criterion (b) while still allowing some export events and note that the number of inferred transmission chains is robust to different values for criterion (a) given criterion (b) (Fig. \ref{fig:sensitivity_figs}c). For a sensitivity analysis on the importance of the specific values of criteria (a) and (b) see the supporting text.

We refer to any Swiss sequence not falling into a Swiss transmission chain as a Swiss singleton. We assume each singleton and each transmission chain represent an independent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into Switzerland; together these are called introductions.

Finally, we repeated this picking procedure twice for each lineage tree, interpreting polytomies in two different ways. Once, we split Swiss clades descending from polytomies into independent introductions unless the polytomy only had a single non-Swiss descendent (see criterion (b)). Alternatively, we aggregated all Swiss clades descending from polytomies into a single introduction. These procedures represent two plausible extremes, yielding either many introductions or few introductions.

\subsection*{Phylodynamic analysis}

After identifying introductions, we performed phylodynamic inference on them using the BDSKY (birth-death skyline) method \cite{stadler2013birth} in BEAST2 \cite{Bouckaert2019}. To avoid model mis-specification due to the more transmissible alpha variant, we analyzed data only through 30 Nov.~2020.  The inference relies on two main models: a nucleotide substitution model describing an evolutionary process and a population dynamical model describing a transmission and sampling process. 


For the nucleotide substitution model, we assumed an HKY \cite{Hasegawa1985} model with 4 Gamma rate categories to account for site-to-site rate heterogeneity \cite{Yang1994}. We used the default priors for kappa and the scale factor of the Gamma distribution. We assumed a strict clock with rate $8\times 10^{-4}$ substitutions per site per year.

We used BDSKY for the population dynamic model. In BDSKY, the identified introductions are the result of a birth-death with sampling process parameterized by an effective reproductive number, a becoming-uninfectious rate, and a sampling probability. As in \cite{Muller2020}, we inferred these population dynamical parameters jointly from the different introductions. More concretely, each introduction is assumed to result from an independent birth-death process having its own start time, but sharing all other parameters with the processes associated with the other introductions. 
Further, we used a uniform prior on the time of origin for each introduction, from 01. Jan to 31. Dec 2020. This means our prior expectation is a uniform rate of introductions through time. We fixed the become-uninfectious rate to 36.5 per year, which corresponds to an average of 10 days to becoming uninfectious. We allowed the effective reproductive number to vary week-to-week. We applied an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck smoothing prior to the logarithm of this parameter, defined such that the stationary distribution of the process was $\text{LogNormal}(0.8, 0.5)$  and with an $\text{Exp}(1)$ hyperprior on the relaxation parameter of the process. This prior constrains both the absolute reproductive number and the relative sizes of the change between weeks. Finally, we allowed the sampling probability to vary when Swiss testing or genome sampling regimes changed significantly (Table S1). For our main analysis, we applied a $\text{LogUniform}(10^{-4}, 1)$ prior on the sampling probability. As a sensitivity analysis, we also tried a $\text{LogUniform}(10^{-4}, 0.05)$ prior since we upper-bounded our sampling to 5\% of confirmed cases each week. See the supporting text for more information.

Then, we added an additional ``contact tracing'' factor to the model. This factor is a multiplicative damping of the effective reproductive number applied to each introduction from 2 days after the first sample date until the introduction dies out. Since we hypothesized contact tracing was not functioning as well during periods of high case numbers, we estimated a separate value in each of three periods: before 15. Jun 2020 (Spring), 15 Jun.~to 30 Sept.~2020 (Summer), and 30. Sept to \maxdate\ (Fall). We used the same spike and slab prior for the damping factor in each period, with an inclusion probability of 0.5 and a uniform prior if included between 0 and 1.
