\subsection{Sensitivity analyses for identifying introductions}
Here we describe different sensitivity analyses we performed for the definition of an introduction. 

\subsubsection{Number of focal Swiss sequences analyzed}
To assess whether the number of identified introductions saturates as we add more sequences, we did a sub-sampling analysis. We sub-sampled the Swiss genome sequences used in our main analysis from 5\% of confirmed cases down to 1\% of confirmed cases. For each new sub-sampling value, we calculated the number of introductions (singletons and transmission chains) that we would have identified given the sub-sampled sequence set. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_figs}a shows that as we add sequences, we do not reach saturation. Therefore, if we were to include even more sequences, we would almost certainly identify more introductions into Switzerland.

\subsubsection{Ratio of foreign context to focal Swiss sequences analyzed}
Next, we assessed how summary statistics about identified introductions and the runtime of our pipeline changed as we added more and more foreign context sequences. We kept the number of focal Swiss sequences constant at 5\% of confirmed cases each week and added foreign context sequences at a 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 ratio to focal Swiss sequences. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_figs}b shows that as we add foreign context sequences, we identify more numerous, smaller introductions. However, the greatest differences come from the different assumptions about how to resolve polytomies (few vs. many introductions), not the ratio of foreign context to focal Swiss sequences. Therefore, we chose to present results using the 2:1 ratio to balance speed (smaller dataset = faster tree search convergence) and information content (larger dataset = more precise estimates of introduction dates).

\subsubsection{Criteria for identifying introductions}
After deciding on a ratio of foreign context to focal Swiss sequences, we assessed how summary statistics about identified introductions changed depending on the precise heuristic definition of an introduction. Given phylogenetic trees with polytomies, we picked transmission chains off of these trees as described in the main text methods. Here, we varied (a) the number of export events allowed in each transmission chain and (b) the maximum number of export events allowed to occur along each single internal branch. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_figs}c shows that increasing (a) yields fewer, larger transmission chains. Increasing (b) for each level of (a) has a much smaller effect. We note that again, the greatest differences come from the different assumptions about how to resolve polytomies. Therefore, we chose to present results using a transmission chain definition based on (a) maximum 3 exported lineages and (b) maximum one consecutive export on each internal branch. This allows for some exports from Swiss transmission chains but not arbitrarily many. 

\subsection{Sensitivity analyses for phylodynamic modelling}
Here we describe different sensitivity analyses we performed for our phylodynamic analysis.

\subsubsection{Sampling proportion prior}
First, we wanted to check that our phylodynamic estimates of a transmission damping factor are robust to our prior on the sampling proportion. Therefore, we repeated our analyses using two different priors on the sampling proportion. The first prior was a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. This broad prior allows the sampling proportion to assume any plausible value. The second prior was a uniform distribution between 0 and an upper bound equal to the number of genome sequences analyzed in a week divided by the number of confirmed cases that week. This narrower prior assumes that there are at least as many cases each week as confirmed cases. Figure \ref{fig:ReSampProbResults}a shows that in Switzerland, the estimated sampling proportion in late Fall 2020 varies greatly depending on the prior. A drop in SARS-CoV-2 diversity in Switzerland during this period might explain why the inference under the broader sampling prior estimates a proportion corresponding to fewer individuals than we know were infected during this time. Figure \ref{fig:ReSampProbResults}b shows that the effective reproductive number estimates in Fall 2020 for Switzerland more closely match estimates based on line-list data when the sampling proportion is treated as a fitting parameter, i.e. under the first, broad prior. Therefore, we report results under this prior in the main text. In Figure \ref{fig:DampingFactorResults}a, we show that the damping factor results are qualitatively similar between the two sampling proportion priors. 

\subsubsection{Population structure: a class of individuals with more contacts}
Next, we wanted to check if our transmission damping factor estimates might be due to individuals returning from travel having more dense contact networks than the general population. Therefore, we repeated our analysis for Switzerland including an additional class of infected individuals who transmit at a higher rate. Let $\pi_N$ be the fraction of normal individuals in the population and $\pi_{SS}$ be the fraction of individuals who have more contacts. Then, the $\pi_{SS}$ fraction of individuals transmit according to the background time-varying reproductive number multiplied by an additional positive factor $r_{SS}$. The parameters $\pi_N$, $\pi_{SS}$, and $r_{SS}$ were all inferred in this analysis. TODO: include figure and discuss results.

\subsection{Logged trees}
Finally, we logged phylogenetic trees for a few introductions. These trees were sampled by the Markov chains in the phylodynamic analyses. Note that the damping factor results are jointly inferred from all the branching events across introductions in each time period. But since logging all introductions would yield huge log files, we logged just a few individual introductions under each set of model assumptions for visual inspection. For each set of model assumptions and each month, we logged trees for the 50th and 95th percentile largest introductions that were first sampled that month and eventually yielded > 2 samples. Figure \ref{fig:logged-chains} shows as an example summary trees for these introductions under the phylodynamic analysis for Switzerland with an un-bounded sampling proportion prior and a homogeneous population (no class of individuals with more contacts).
