\section{Sensitivity analyses}

In this section, we describe our decision-making process to choose parameters for our phylogenetic analysis and report on the sensitivity of our results to these choices. 

\subsection{Down-sampling Swiss sequences}
We aim to include Swiss sequences that are spatio-temporally representative of the Swiss epidemic. Therefore, we down-sample available Swiss sequences proportional to confirmed case counts at the regional (cantonal) level. To assess whether the number of transmission chains saturates as we add more and more sequences, we did a saturation analysis. TODO: add figure and discuss implications.

\subsection{Ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences}
We investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to different ratios of genetically similar context sequences from abroad to focal Swiss sequences. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_context_set_size} shows that increasing the ratio of context to focal sequences from 1:1 to 3:1 increases the number of estimated transmission chains and decreases their mean size. However, the greatest differences in estimated transmission chains result from the different assumptions about how to resolve phylogenetic uncertainty (few vs. many introductions), not the ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences. Therefore, we chose the 2:1 ratio as a balance of speed (smaller dataset = faster tree search convergence) and information content (larger dataset = more precise estimates of introduction dates). We rely on the difference between the few and many introductions assumptions to represent uncertainty in the transmission chains.

\subsection{Transmission chain criteria}
After deciding on a ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences, we investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to our criteria for picking transmission chains. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_m_p} shows that increasing the maximum number of exported lineages decreases the number of transmission chains and increases their size. Increasing the maximum consecutive exports has a much smaller effect. But again, these differences are smaller than those resulting from the different assumptions about how to resolve phylogenetic uncertainty (few vs. many introductions). Therefore, we chose our criteria to be maximum 3 exported lineages and maximum one consecutive export to allow for some exports but not arbitrarily many. 

\subsection{Upper-bounding sampling proportion}
Genome-based estimates for the effective reproductive number in Switzerland are for the most part robust to the different transmission chain definitions and largely match estimates based on confirmed case counts (Figure \ref{fig:re}). One exception is in October 2020, when genome-based estimates are lower than confirmed case counts unless the sampling proportion is treated as a fitting parameter. A drop in genome diversity during this period might explain the discrepancy. 

\subsection{Including a ``super-spreader'' deme}
We checked whether our estimate of a transmission slow-down upon introduction sampling was robust to the inclusion of super-spreading individuals in the model. Therefore, we included a second deme in the analysis. Let $\pi_N$ be the fraction of normal individuals and $\pi_{SS}$ be the fraction of super-spreading individuals in the population. Super-spreading individuals transmit according to the master time-varying reproductive number multiplied by an additional positive factor $r_{SS}$. $\pi_N$, $\pi_{SS}$, and $r_{SS}$ are all inferred parameters.

\caption{Various phylodynamic models employed for the main analysis and sensitivity checks. The ``Base model'' was used to generate the main text figures. Models with a ``Damping factor'' include a parameter representing a possible transmission slow-down upon sampling. Models with a ``SS deme'' include a second deme representing super-spreaders. Models with ``Bounded sampling'' have the sampling proportion restricted to be less than the number of genomes divided by the number of confirmed cases.}
