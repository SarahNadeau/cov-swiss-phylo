\section{Validation}
Samples from cases who report they were exposed abroad can help validate the transmission chains inferred from the phylodynamic tree. Taking reported exposures as the ground truth, we expect cases exposed abroad to be the index cases in Swiss transmission chains. Therefore, we ran a validation analysis running our phylodynamic analysis on sequences from \maxsamplingpercentval\% of confirmed cases in Switzerland, preferentially taking samples with recorded foreign exposures. We constructed the context sequence set for this analysis as for the main analysis, taking \gensimscalefactorval\ times as many most genetically similar foreign genomes as Swiss genomes for each PANGO lineage and \travelcontextscalefactorval\ times as many foreign genomes as Swiss genomes proportionally to monthly incidence- and travel-based estimates of SARS-CoV-2 imports (recorded exposures, tourist arrivals) and irregardless of PANGO lineage.

\subsection{Validation data}
In Switzerland, patient exposure information is recorded in the meldungen zum klinischen befund (MKB) form submitted to the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH). Testing and MKB reporting criteria changed several times during the study period. % TODO: make table of this text
Beginning 31. January 2020, all symptomatic patients or patients with close exposure to another case were tested, and all positive patients were MKB-reportable. Beginning 13. March 2020, only symptomatic patients with symptoms sufficient for hospitalization, in a risk group, or working in healthcare were tested, and all positive patients were MKB-reportable. Beginning 20. March 2020, only hospitalized patients were MKB-reportable. Beginning 16. April 2020, patients in care homes were also MKB-reportable. Beginning 22. April 2020, all symptomatic patients were tested but the MKB-reporting criteria did not change. Beginning 11. May 2020, all positive patients were again MKB-reportable. Beginning 28. October 2020, again only hospitalized patients or patients in care homes were MKB-reportable.
