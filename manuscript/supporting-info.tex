\section{Sensitivity analyses}
We investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to different ratios of genetically similar foreign context sequences to focal Swiss sequences. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_context_set_size} shows that as the context set size is increased from a 1:1 to 3:1 ratio, the number of estimated transmission chains increases and the mean size of the transmission chains decreases. However, the greatest differences in estimated transmission chains result from the different assumptions about how to resolve phylogenetic uncertainty (smallest vs. largest plausible chains), not the size of the foreign context set. Therefore, we chose the 2:1 ratio as a balance of speed (smaller dataset = faster tree search convergence) and information content (larger dataset = more precise estimates of transmission chain import dates). We rely on the different polytomy resolutions from one such tree to incorporate most of the uncertainty in transmission chain definition.

\end{figure*}

After deciding what size foreign context set to use, we investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to our heuristic definition of a transmission chain. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_m_p} shows that again, the greatest differences in estimated transmission chains result from different assumptions about how to resolve phylogenetic uncertainty, not the heuristic definition of a transmission chain. Therefore, we chose to define transmission chains based on maximum 3 exported lineages and maximum one consecutive export along a branch to allow for some exports but not arbitrarily many.

Finally, we investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to the number of focal Swiss sequences analyzed.
