\section{Sensitivity analyses}

At the very high level, we define Swiss transmission chains by picking Swiss clades off of phylogenetic trees including a mix of Swiss and foreign sequences. More specifically, we analyze sequences from 1\% of confirmed cases in Switzerland each week. After dividing these into pangolin lineages, we add genetically similar foreign sequences at a 2:1 ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences. After building a maximum likelihood tree for each pangolin lineage, we define Swiss transmission chain as clades of Swiss sequences with maximum 3 apparent re-exports to other countries and no more than one export in a row along the internal branches. Below, we describe how we decided on these values. 

\subsection{Downsampling Swiss sequences}
We aim to include Swiss sequences that are spatio-temporally representative of the Swiss epidemic. Therefore, we down-sample available Swiss sequences proportional to confirmed case counts at the regional (cantonal) level. To assess whether the number of transmission chains saturates as we add more and more sequences, we did a saturation analysis. TODO: add figure and discuss implications.

\subsection{Ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences}
We investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to different ratios of genetically similar foreign sequences to Swiss sequences. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_context_set_size} shows that increasing the ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences from 1:1 to 3:1 increases the number of estimated transmission chains and decreases their mean size. However, the greatest differences in estimated transmission chains result from the different assumptions about how to resolve phylogenetic uncertainty (smallest vs. largest plausible chains), not the ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences. Therefore, we chose the 2:1 ratio as a balance of speed (smaller dataset = faster tree search convergence) and information content (larger dataset = more precise estimates of transmission chain import dates). We rely on the difference between the smallest and largest plausible chains picked from one such tree to represent uncertainty in the transmission chains.

\subsection{Transmission chain criteria}
After deciding on a ratio of foreign to Swiss sequences, we investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to our criteria for picking transmission chains. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_m_p} shows that increasing the maximum number of exported lineages decreases the number of transmission chains and increases their size. Increasing the maximum consecutive exports has a much smaller effect. But again, these differences are smaller than those resulting from the different assumptions about how to resolve phylogenetic uncertainty (smallest vs. largest plausible chains). Therefore, we chose our criteria to be maximum 3 exported lineages and maximum one consecutive export to allow for some exports but not arbitrarily many.
