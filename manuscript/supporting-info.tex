\section{Sensitivity analyses}
We investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to different ratios of focal Swiss sequences to genetically similar foreign context sequences. Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity_context_set_size} shows that as the size of the context set is increased from a 1:1 ratio to a 3:1 ratio, the number of transmission chains estimated increases and the mean size of transmission chains decreases. However, these differences are smaller than the differences within each analysis, depending on whether the smallest or largest plausible transmission chains are assumed. Therefore, we chose the 2:1 ratio as a balance of speed (smaller dataset = faster tree search convergence) and information content (larger dataset = more precise estimates of transmission chain import dates) and rely on the different transmission chain assumptions within this analysis to incorporate most of the uncertainty in transmission chain definition.

We investigated the sensitivity of transmission chain summary statistics to the number of focal Swiss sequences analyzed.
